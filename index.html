					I
					have
					been
					knitting
					for
					about
					15
					years.
					I
					love
					the
					blend
					of
					creativity
					and
					mindfulness
					that
					this
					hobby
					brings.
					I
					also
					love
					that
					I
					make
					things
					from
					string
					and
					sticks.
					I
					feel
					magical!

					I

					Sometimes
					we
					knit,
					sometimes
					we
					geek
					out
					on
					new
					research
					in
					education.
					Sometimes
					we
					just
					tell
					jokes.

					I

					I

					I'm

					spaces
					like
					education
					and

					It

					things
					I
					think
					about
					in
